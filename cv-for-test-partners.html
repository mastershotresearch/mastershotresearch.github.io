<h2 class="f2 measure lh-title">Skills</h2>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">I understand the needs of disabled and elderly people</h3>
<p>I’ve carried out dozens of user research sessions with disabled and elderly participants; I regularly participate in forums where those users express their concerns and difficulties; I’ve volunteered for three years for the charity Independent Age, which allows me to meet elderly people on a weekly basis, and better understand their needs and frustrations.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">I can assess if a website works for disabled and elderly people</h3>
<p>I can use different methods to find that out. I can carry out a WCAG 2.1 audit of a website; I can test a website with assistive technologies such as Jaws, ZoomText, or Dragon Naturally Speaking; I can carry out heuristic evaluations of digital products; can get users involved in usability testing sessions – I’ve worked as a user researcher for the last five years.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">I can speak developers’ language</h3>
<p>I’ve worked building digital products for more than fifteen years. In the last five years, I’ve been part of Scrum teams made up mainly of developers and testers. I know how developers work and think. This allows me to explain to them why a digital product doesn’t work for disabled or elderly people, and what they need to do to fix the problems identified.</p>

<h2 class="f2 measure lh-title">Work experience</h2>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">Senior User Researcher for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/homes-england">Homes England</a></h3>
<p>01/2020–Today</p>
<p>I am the user researcher of Scrum team that aims to make the data that Homes England produces available to all employees that need it. I am helping out my team by finding out a) what information each employee needs to carry out their job; b) how users currently go about gathering that information; c) what new pieces of information would make their jobs easier. To find that out, I’m mainly using contextual interviews — learning how users work by being close to them.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">Senior User Researcher for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">Department of Work and Pensions</a></h3>
<p>01/2019–1/2020</p>
<p>I was the user researcher of a Scrum team that was building a program called Searchlight, which is used by more than 80,000 employees from different government departments. When I joined the team, the program was in private beta, and when I left it was fully functional and available to everyone. My job consisted in providing insights to the team so that we could progress confidently during that process. I used the following research methods: contextual interviews with more than 40 users; a survey with more than 3,000 respondents; 6 rounds of usability tests; 3 concept value tests; 1 content analysis of the feedback received from users; and 1 tree test with more than 200 users. To document the research done, I’ve created written reports, slides, and journey maps.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">Lead User Researcher for the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/">NHS Business Service Authority</a></h3>
<p>03/2018–12/2018</p>
<p>I was the main user researcher of the organisation. As such, my main responsibilities were to coordinate a team of 10 user researchers working in different services, and to make sure that the research done was sound, useful, and effective. During my time at the NHS, I assessed the performance of each of the user researchers; I hired new researchers for the organisation; I helped teams to prepare GDS assessments; I organised the weekly community meetings; I set up a library of user research reports; and, occasionally, I carried out user research — 2 round of usability tests.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">Senior User researcher for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HM Revenue & Customs</a></h3>
<p>01/2016–02/2018</p>
<p>Among other responsibilities, I was the main user researcher for the Personal tax account, a platform used by more than 10 million users every year. I helped out my team by doing different types of research activities: 4 rounds of usability tests for desktop; 4 rounds of usability tests for mobile devices; 1 open card sort; 2 tree tests; and 1 heuristic evaluation. Apart from sharing insights with the team, I also engaged with senior stakeholders within HMRC.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">Senior UX consultant for <a href="http://www.heathwallace.com/">HeathWallace</a></h3>
<p>10/2014–12/2015</p>
<p>I was part of the team that was designing the online banking website of an international bank. I was responsible of understanding the business requirements; transforming those requirements into usable interfaces; presenting the designs to stakeholders from several countries; helping the client to evolve their design system; and planning the research sessions to assess those designs.</p>

<h3 class="f3 measure lh-title">Usability & accessibility consultant for <a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a></h3>
<p>10/2013–10/2014</p>
<p>I helped our clients (Barclays, Tesco, HSBC, etc) to make sure that their websites and apps were accessible. I did that by running usability tests with disabled people, and assessing websites and apps with assistive technology, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. These activities were documented in reports where I presented a prioritised list of all the barriers found during the audit, and gave recommendations to fix those problems.</p>
